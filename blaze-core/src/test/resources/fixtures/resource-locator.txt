## What is a blaze script?

A Blaze script is a 100% valid JVM class with public methods that typically uses
an empty (root) package declaration.  Each public method becomes the externally
accessible task that can be called from the command-line. Since most JVM languages
support this kind of structure, Blaze can easily support a wide variety of 
JVM languages.

## Install to your project

Download `blaze.jar` to your project directory.  If you have `wget` available

    wget -O blaze.jar 'http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fizzed/blaze-lite/0.9.1/blaze-lite-0.9.1.jar'

If you have `curl` available

    curl -o blaze.jar 'http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fizzed/blaze-lite/0.9.1/blaze-lite-0.9.1.jar'

Or simply [download the file in your web browser](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fizzed/blaze-lite/0.9.1/blaze-lite-0.9.1.jar)
and save it to your project directory with a name of `blaze.jar`
